Hi guys, it's Atom here.

I want to make sure that if anyone is willing to contribute, this is a great place to start!

The code here is subject to automatic documentation by sphinx-gallery, https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery.

It's what Scikit-learn uses to boast the greatness of their code, so I thought we could use it too.

Only files which have the string `plot` included in thier filename will be processed.

Have fun!

Just make sure to check the dependencies, I'll list them below.

Sphinx-Gallery will not manage its dependencies when installing, thus you are required to install them manually. Our minimal dependencies are:

    Sphinx >= 1.8.3
    Matplotlib
    Pillow

Sphinx-Gallery has also support for packages like:

    Seaborn
    Mayavi
