## Coding styles
- Follow `PEP8` as much as possible
  - [English](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  - [日本語](http://pep8-ja.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/)
- Write a description as **NumPy Style Python Docstring**
  - [numpydoc docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)


  ```python
  def PCA(X, whiten = False):
    '''
      apply PCA
      components, explained_variance = PCA(X)

      Parameters
      ----------
      X: ndarray, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        matrix of input vectors

      whiten: boolean
        if it is True, the data is treated as whitened
        on each dimensions (average is 0 and variance is 1)

      Returns
      -------
      components: ndarray, shape (n_features, n_features)
        the normalized component vectors

      explained_variance: ndarray, shape (n_features)
        the variance of each vectors

    ...
  ```
